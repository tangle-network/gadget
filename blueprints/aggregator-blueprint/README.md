# <h1 align="center"> Aggregator Blueprint 🌐 </h1>

**A simple BLS Aggregator Blueprint for use with Tangle AVSs**

## 📚 Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Forge](https://getfoundry.sh)
- [Tangle](https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle?tab=readme-ov-file#-getting-started-)

You will also need to install `cargo-gadget`:

```sh
cargo install cargo-gadget
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Once `cargo-gadget` is installed, you can create a new project with the following command:

```sh
cargo gadget create --name <project-name>
```

and follow the instructions to create a new project.

## 🛠️ Development

Once you have created a new project, you can run the following command to start the project:

```sh
cargo build
```
to build the project, and

```sh
cargo gadget deploy
```
to deploy the blueprint to the Tangle network.

## 📚 Overview

This aggregator exemplifies the possibilities of blueprints by running a BLS Aggregator on the Tangle Network using a Blueprint. Blueprints are specifications for Actively Validated Services (AVS) on the Tangle Network. An AVS is an off-chain service that runs arbitrary computations for a user-specified period of time.

Blueprints provide a useful abstraction, allowing developers to create reusable service infrastructures as if they were smart contracts. This enables developers to monetize their work and align long-term incentives with the success of their creations, benefiting proportionally to their Blueprint's usage.
